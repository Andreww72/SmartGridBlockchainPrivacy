# Smart-Grid-Blockchain-Privacy

Preserving User Anonymity in Smart Grid Blockchain Transactions

Engineering Computer and Software Systems Honours Thesis

This project aims to contribute to the study of user anonymity in an Internet of Things Blockchain. The project will explore methods to deanonymise users with machine learning. This analysis will include stored Blockchain transactions and off-the-chain data. Section 1 will investigate the topic and surrounding literature. We will then identify the projectâ€™s research problem, objectives, questions, scope, and propose a preliminary methodology to complete the project. The aim is to determine how effective machine learning is to deanonymise smart grid Blockchain users. This should highlight long-term anonymity risks of Blockchain by analysing permanent transaction data. The approach will first, source energy grid data and populate a Blockchain. Second, apply machine learning analysis on the Blockchain to link users and transactions. Third, incorporate off-the-chain data such as climate, zone distribution, and outages. Last, the project will investigate and measure methods to improve user privacy. Project outcomes will include a better understanding of user privacy risks in the discussed scenario.
